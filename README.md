# Virtual-Assistant-using-Python.py
Developed a voice-activated Virtual Assistant using Python to perform a range of automated tasks and provide real-time responses. The assistant can interpret voice commands or text input and execute actions such as opening applications, searching the web, sending emails, playing music, and providing weather updates or general information.

ðŸ“„ Overview

Opening popular websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn

Playing music from a predefined library

ðŸ§° Dependencies
Install the required libraries before running the script:

bash
Copy
Edit

pip install pyttsx3
pip install pyaudio
Ensure you also have:

A working microphone

A musicLibrary.py file with a dictionary named music that maps song names to URLs.

ðŸ§  Features

ðŸš€ Future Improvements
Replace pyttsx3 with gTTS and pygame for better voice quality.
